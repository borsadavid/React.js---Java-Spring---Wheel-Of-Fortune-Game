Game made in React.js and Java Spring where up to 6 players try to guess a secret phrase.
Backend is on another branch.

They can use their round to either try to guess a letter or try to guess the phrase.   
Guessing the phrase gives more points (multiplied by missing words).
Not guessing in enough in set rounds decides a winner early.
The player with most points wins.
You can choose how many rounds there are, and see all used letters.
